What is Edan?
-------------

Edan, a user-focused cryptocurrency, which you can spend anywhere, anytime and anytime what amount for charges less than 1 cent.
The users may decide to take advantage of optional privacy offers by Edan. Edan uses Proof of Service (PoSe) and Proof of Work (PoW) to secure his blockchain. 
Proof of work is provided by minors, while proofs of service are provided by masternodes, where some people are ready to implant a certain amount of Edan in the network to show their commitment to the network and specific tasks.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Dash Core software, see https://www.projetedan.org/get-edan/.

Feature
-------------------
PrivateSend is a payment anonymization service. Similar to cryptocurrency tumblers, it uses a coin shuffle strategy to keep transactions anonymous and untraceable. Each payment is passed through masternodes in a few rounds of mixing. Since each participant in the mixing session only signs their transaction entry, it is impossible to know where the money is going. Once all participants have signed their entries, they are sent to the network. The mixing process can be repeated up to eight times. The more mixing cycles there are, the more difficult it is to track the original shipper of parts.

InstantSend is an instant transactions service. A transaction is verified by consensus of randomly selected masternodes. Then it is added to the next block. As a result, masternodes guarantee near instant confirmation of transactions, so there is no need to wait for standard block confirmations. Similar to PrivateSend, masternodes charge fees for instant confirmation of transactions.

The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a network service which allows all members of the community to make proposals for network development and to vote. The DAO is funded by block rewards: periodically generated superblocks provide a higher percentage of the reward to the DAO. So, in a way, DAO turns the Edan network into a kind of self-regulating entity.

Edan masternodes provide proof of service and additional network security. They run all of the services mentioned above and are enticed to do so by the block rewards they receive alongside miners.

Sporks are a mechanism to safely deploy and activate new functionality after updating the node software. This mechanism was first implemented by Dash. Sporks are used to ensure simultaneous updates of the entire network so that the new logic is applied correctly. Sporks are activated with a special service message broadcast from one of the developer addresses across the network. Self-regulation, anonymity, fast payments, masternode services and the spork mechanism make Edan one of the best blockchains. However, there is one feature that may scare some users off - the Proof of Work consensus algorithm. While consensus is implemented more efficiently in Dash than in Bitcoin, it still consumes a lot of time and energy.


Edan algorithm
---------------

Proof of Work

Proof of Work (PoW) is a type of blockchain consensus algorithm that authorizes transactions through the mining of blocks that are ultimately added to the blockchain. This goal is achieved through the use of mining platforms.

Proof of service

Proof of Service (PoSe) is a type of consensus algorithm where some people who wish to participate in consensus on the network provide a certain amount of coins called a wager which is usually in the base currency of the blockchain network. They are then allowed to participate in consensus by verifying transactions, adding blocks, and voting in certain decisions. They have a chance of losing some or all of their stake if they turn out to be dishonest, and they are rewarded if they act honestly. This serves as an incentive to drive honesty into the consensus process.

Mission note
-------------

Edan believes that Blockchain technology will remove transaction barriers, increase the efficiency of transactions in society, and ultimately have a huge impact on the global economy. We aspire to change the world, especially Africa, and to never stop innovating to improve the comfort of our community.

Safe & Anonymous
Security is another very important point on which today's world stands. By using Electra you can make secure payments be done, which gives confidence to the community.

Treasury system
Another feature of Edan is the system of Treasury. Along with most other cryptocurrencies, all newly mined coins go to miners. In the network Edan, 45% go to miners, 45% go to masternodes and 10% of the newly mined coins go to a DAO municipal treasury, which finances the development of Edan.
